website development for milk*ame art circle

Setting up a website for a group of artists (aeror404, yuukou__, blackteahime).  The portfolio website is intended for us to post intended appearances at conventions, samples and links to our work, and shop/contact information.  It will be a simple HTML5/CSS site.

As of 2020 work on the site was put on hold as appearances at events have been cancelled.
